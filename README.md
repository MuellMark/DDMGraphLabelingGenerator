# DDMGraphLabelingGenerator

This repo is for generating and visualizing graphs of the DDM labeling

There are 2 parts to this repo, the java portion, which is responsible for generating the graphs, and the python portion, which is responisible for generating the visualization of the graphs found in the java code.

### Getting Started
If the only thing you are interested in seeing are the visualizations, click here: https://github.com/MuellMark/DDMGraphLabelingGenerator/blob/Mueller/GraphVisualizations/GraphVisualization.md. This will take you to a separate markdown file explaining all of the graphs that have already been generated and their visualizations

This code was built on VSCode using java 1.8.0_341 and python 3.9.7. The only things that needed to be installed were networkx and matplotlib, which were pip-installed. Below are some helpful links if you're having trouble getting it setup:\
Networkx documentation: https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/install.html \
Matplotlib documentation: https://matplotlib.org/stable/users/installing/index.html \
In case you have issues pip-installing in VSCode: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42463866/how-to-use-pip-with-visual-studio-code

Once you have everything installed, you can look at the other two markdown files below for more information on how to generate and visualize graphs.
### Java
The java code is responsible for the genertion of all of the text versions of the graphs. All of the code can be found in the Java Code folder with explanations
found in the .md file, or here: TODO
### Python
-The python code is responsible for taking in an txt output from the java code and visualizing it. This is done with networkx and matplotlib. All of the code is in
the Python Code folder and explaniatinos can be found in the .md file, or here: TODO
##### Legacy Code
All past code that didn't end up getting used can be found in the Legacy Code Folder, with explaniations found in the .md file, or here: https://github.com/MuellMark/DDMGraphLabelingGenerator/blob/Mueller/Legacy%20Code/LegacyCode.md
